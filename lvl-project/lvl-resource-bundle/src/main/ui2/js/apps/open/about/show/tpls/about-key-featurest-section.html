<p>
	This section describes some of the key features that make the 
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a> a unique and valuable tool for the
	Leishmaniasis research community.
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Data collections curated by experts</h5>
<p>
	Despite the detached data exist independently in other major databases, such as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank">GenBank</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">PubMed</a>, there are many evidences that the records 
	of these databases can be polluted by errors arising from various sources, including erroneous classification of the species and other inaccurate 
	annotations. Therefore, one of the major contributions of the 
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a> is to provide a database curated 
	by experts where the major part of those errors have been identified and eliminated.
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Connecting communities as the means to success</h5>
<p>
	Expert users are notified when new data become available in the 
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a>, and they are provided with a list 
	of possible improvements as well as possible relationships that could exist with other data previously included in the
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a>. These revisions are approved by 
	consensus, relying on social network technologies to share and discuss the identified improvements. This strategy facilitates the participation 
	of community members in the process of data curation, with the objective of maximizing the number of reviews that is performed on an unreleased 
	dataset.
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Augmented metadata</h5>
<p>
	The data is annotated with additional metadata, computed from the existing fields in the source databases and cross-validated with additional 
	information found in other databases. The automatic inference of geospatial coordinates deserves special mention, because of its importance 
	for understanding the spread of Leishmaniasis. Currently, the number of DNA sequences annotated with geospatial coordinates on
	<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank">GenBank</a> is insufficient to allow this kind of analysis. The 
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a> has geo-annotated thousands of 
	DNA sequences distributed worldwide combining the analysis of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank">GenBank</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">PubMed</a> records.
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Maintains data provenance</h5>
<p>
	The new data is integrated in the <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a> 
	with the original information about the origin of the data, how the data has been collected, stored and altered. Every data manipulation and
	edit can be tracked, discovered and audited.	
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Continuously updating</h5>
<p>
	The <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a> delivers a set of specific tools 
	to monitor the source databases where the data is originally submitted, automatically detecting any new information that could be relevant for the 
	<a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>sh VirtLab</a>, fetching the data from the source 
	database and performing a pre-process to identify possible errors and missing content. Our users can benefit immediately from these updates, 
	without needing to wait for a new release of the database.
</p>
<br>
<h5><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> Open access &amp; interoperability are first-class citizens</h5>
<p>
	Data format compatibility with major biological databases is maintained. The connectors, manuals and instructions for gathering and processing 
	the records from our collections are also provided as open-source, in order to facilitate interoperability with other system and databases.
