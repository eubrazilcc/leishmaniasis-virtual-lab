<p>
	The main objective of the <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>shVL</a> is to
	provide a database of quality data composed of DNA sequences, journal citations and other clinical and biological data related to Leishmaniasis, 
	as well as the parasite (<i>Leishmania spp.</i>) that causes the disease and the vector (phlebotomine sandflies) that spreads it.
</p>
<p>
	The major part of this data is collected from public biological databases, such as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank">GenBank</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">PubMed</a>. More specific but equally important collections, such as 
	<a href="http://clioc.fiocruz.br/" target="_blank">CLIOC</a>, <a href="http://colfleb.fiocruz.br/" target="_blank">COLFLEB</a> and the 
	<a href="http://www.isciii.es/" target="_blank">ISCIII-WHO-CCL</a> collection, are also included in the system.	
</p>
<p>
	The <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>shVL</a> contributes to improve the 
	quality of these datasets and make them available for <i>Leishmania</i> and sandfly species identification and other tasks that are of paramount 
	importance for the prevention and control of Leishmaniasis.
</p>
<p>
	The objectives of this project also include standardizing and maintaining the different collections integrated within this system,
	as well as designing the curation processes and developing the quality verification and validation tools that assist researchers in their work.	
</p>
<p>
	Whithin the <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>shVL</a>, the data is seamless 
	integrated with the data processing tools in a single location. The following list provides an example of the tools and datasets provided:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pre-processing and data curation pipelines;</li>
	<li>Species consensus DNA sequences;</li>
	<li>Molecular pipelines for the identification and classification of species;</li>
	<li>Tools for automatic annotation of records.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The <a href="/#home" title="Leishmaniasis Virtual Laboratory">L<span class="text-danger">ei</span>shVL</a> takes over from the Leishmaniasis 
	e-compendium of the <a href="http://www.who.int/" target="_blank">WHO</a> Leishmaniasis Control Programme to produce an updated e-compendium 
	of peer-reviewed literature on leishmaniasis epidemiology.
